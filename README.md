# efood_assignment

This repository contains all neccessary files and and data that were used for the assignment provided by efood for the position of the business intelligence analyst.

# Tools used

1) Biq Query
2) Tableau
3) Powerpoint

**Details about tools and outputs:**

1) For this assignment I used BigQuery since it was recommended in the assignment details and also to make it easier to evaluate. The exploratory analysis code can be found in this repo.
2) For the visualization I used Tableau and uploaded the workbook publicly. I will not be uploading the tableau workbook since it is not possible in the public version of the program.
3) Lastly, besides the code and the link to the tableau dashboard you will also find in this repo my presentation in the form of a file which will contain findings and graphs that were copied from the tableau dashboard.
4) You will not find any instructions here since the code I will upload can be simply run in Biq Query after loading the input file into it. You can interact with the visualization just by clicking in the link provided in the 'Visualization' folder. The presentation can be simply downloaded.

# Folders
